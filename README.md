# SENTIMENTAL-ANALYSIS
Introduction to Natural Language ProcessingÂ¶
Natural Language Processing (NLP): The discipline of computer science, artificial intelligence and linguistics that is concerned with the creation of computational models that process and understand natural language. These include: making the computer understand the semantic grouping of words (e.g. cat and dog are semantically more similar than cat and spoon), text to speech, language translation and many more

Sentiment Analysis: It is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, negative and neutral) within text data using text analysis techniques. Sentiment analysis allows organizations to identify public sentiment towards certain words or topics.

In this notebook, we'll develop a Sequence model that can perform Sentiment Analysis to categorize a tweet as Positive or Negative.
The dataset being used is the sentiment140 dataset. It contains 1,600,000 tweets extracted using the Twitter API. The tweets have been annotated (0 = Negative, 4 = Positive) and they can be used to detect Sentiment

It contains the following 6 fields:

sentiment: the polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 4 = positive)
ids: The id of the tweet (2087)
date: the date of the tweet (Sat May 16 23:58:44 UTC 2009)
flag: The query (lyx). If there is no query, then this value is NO_QUERY.
user: the user that tweeted (robotickilldozr)
text: the text of the tweet (Lyx is cool)
